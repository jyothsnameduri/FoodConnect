# FoodShare Platform - Post Management and Feed/Map System

Design the core functionality interfaces for the FoodShare platform, focusing on creating, viewing, and interacting with food donation and request posts. Follow the established theme palette and visual identity guidelines.

## Theme Implementation

- **Color Coding System**:
  * Use Main Green (#4CAF50) for donation-related elements and positive actions
  * Use Soft Blue (#42A5F5) for request-related elements and support actions
  * Use Warm Orange (#FF9800) for community, sharing, and engagement elements

- **UI Components**:
  * **Cards**: 8px rounded corners, subtle drop shadows, thin borders, clear color-coding for donation vs request posts
  * **Buttons**: 
    - Primary: Filled green with white text
    - Secondary: Outlined with corresponding color
    - Tertiary: Text-only with color accent

  * Subtle scale effect on interactive elements (1.02x)
